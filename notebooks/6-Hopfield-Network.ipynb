    "**A Hopfield Network is a type of recurrent artificial neural network** that serves as a content-addressable memory system, meaning it can recall stored patterns from incomplete or noisy inputs. Introduced by John Hopfield in 1982 (but very similar ideas were already proposed by Kaoru Nakano in 1971 and Shun'ichi Amari in 1972), these networks are composed of a single layer of interconnected neurons, where each neuron is both an input and output, and connections between them are symmetric; for his foundational contributions to machine learning Hopfield has been awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics shared with Geoffrey Hinton.  \n",
